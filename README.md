ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the computer opponent uses the Minimax Algorithm. The AI is unbeatable â€” it always plays the best possible move.

**ðŸš€ Features**

âœ… Play Tic Tac Toe against an AI that never loses

âœ… Implemented using the Minimax Algorithm (game theory + recursion)

âœ… Interactive UI with responsive design

âœ… Shows real-time results (Win, Lose, or Draw)

**ðŸ§  What is Minimax Algorithm?**

The Minimax Algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in Game Theory and AI.

It tries to maximize the player's chance of winning while minimizing the opponentâ€™s chance.

In this project, the AI evaluates all possible moves and always chooses the optimal one, making it impossible to beat.
